                I made this website myself in pure html, css, and some javascript as god intended. 
                I'm currently hosting this through github pages with the super duper awesome domain
                name of jorge.party.

                In the second semester at Stevens, I had a course where, for the next 14 weeks, we would
                familiarize ourselves with problem solving in a more optimal way to deliver what people would
                really want from a product. My team and I ended up making an end product we're all very proud 
                to have delivered. You can watch the final video we made 
                <a class = "red" href="https://youtu.be/bKL-hlo0nV4">here</a> and the website 
                <a class = "red" href="https://jorge-wbh.github.io/CommuteLock/">here</a>.

                    For a hackathon in 2022 me and one of my friends were tasked with making a project in under 24 hours.
                    We chose to take the beginner track and make an educational website for math. And so, under the code name of
                    "Horrendous Hackers" we started making a website with very little time to spare and no idea how to host it.
                    In the end, it didn't win any awards but still became a great accomplishment for us.

                    Amidst the chaos from the pandemic in 2021, me and a buddy decided to compete in a competition hosted by our
                    high school called: "HTHS-Columbia Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers Website Design Challenge" After
                    a long time of working and researching we came up with "LockdownLife" which won us first place in that competition.
