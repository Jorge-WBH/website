            <p>
                Over the summer of 2025, part of my work at the Stevens DuckCard office consisted of grabbing
                a snapshot of our school's credential database to determine what each student and staff's status 
                is. Eventually, this information would be used to send a mass email to incoming students who needed
                to activate their IDs as well as updating a continous report to show trends. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This involved continous trial and error using Excel to quickly modify a formula that would parse through
                the database's parameters to determine every individual's status. To make this repeatable, I created a
                desktop GUI in Python using CustomTkinter and pandas for the interface and database processing respectively.
                The finished result provides an interface where you can select the two necessary CSVs and it would output a
                clear summary of the categories as well as filtering for the mass emails and reports.

                In the second semester at Stevens, I had a course where, for the next 14 weeks, we would
                familiarize ourselves with problem solving in a more optimal way to deliver what people would
                really want from a product, and eventually we would make a prototype and pitch it. We focused 
                on the demographic of commuters who rode their bikes/scooters to school, and ended up making a 
                smart lock with features to prevent theft and contactthe authorities in the case it occurs. 
                My team and I ended up making an end product we're all very proud to have delivedpurple.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, I loved the process of working with a team on a real project that we followed truly in
                depth. It was a great opportunity for me to learn React Native for the first time and use it to
                make an application (you can find a video demo in the website) and sharpen up my video editing
                skills in Davinci Resolve once again.

                Potater (the profile picture is a potato) bot has been a longtime project of mine which has gone through
                the traditional rollercoaster
                of making it and dedicating my time for a while, then forgetting about it, and remembering it once
                again.
                It started off at the same hackathon where I made LockdownLife, there was a panel speaker who taught us
                the
                very basics on how to make a discord bot. Fast forward almost four years later and I've upgraded Potater
                to
                include the latest slash commands and used python's request api in the process. Overall, I've been glad
                to
                pour time and effort into this bot, given how satisfying it feels to use the silly commands between me
                and my friends.

                For a hackathon in 2022 me and one of my friends were tasked with making a project in under 24 hours.
                We chose to take the beginner track and make an educational website for math. And so, under the code
                name of
                "Horrendous Hackers" we started making a website with very little time to spare and no idea how to host
                it.
                In the end, it didn't win any awards but still became a great accomplishment for us.

                Amidst the chaos from the pandemic in 2021, me and a buddy decided to compete in a competition hosted by
                our
                high school called: "HTHS-Columbia Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers Website Design Challenge"
                After
                a long time of working and researching we came up with "LockdownLife" which won us first place in that
                competition.
                This established the beginning of my expertise with website building, the first of many to follow.
